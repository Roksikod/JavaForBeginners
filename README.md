# Java Programming Basics Training Repository

üìùThis repository is _for educational purposes_.

It was created based on lectures taught at the Technical University of St. Petersburg Russia.

## I did the practical work myself.

During the training, I studied the basics of Java programming:

- Programming language syntax, 
- keywords & access modifiers, 
- creating and working with collections, 
- object-oriented programming and its principles (inheritance, polymorphism), 
- generics, 
- wrappers and interfaces, 
- exception handling, 
- input and output streams, 
- StreamAPI and multithreading.
